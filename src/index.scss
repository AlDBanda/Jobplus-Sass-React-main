// In here we have all the imports we want to apply to all components 
// in our project.

// Variables and breakpoints can't be defined here, because of scoping issues.
// They have to be defined in the component's scss file.
// So for that we can manually import the variables and breakpoints files in each component's scss file.
// or use something like sass resourrce loader to import them globally.
